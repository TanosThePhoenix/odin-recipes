        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Cheese quesadillas are a quick dish that can be served up almost immediately after cooking starts. Requiring just two ingredients, a pan, a spatula, and a stovetop, both the items needed and the cleanup afterwards should not be too difficult.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Flour Tortilla</li>
            <li>Sliced Cheese (Personal Recommendation: Cheddar)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps to Cook</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Set the stove to high and place an appropriately sized pan on it. Place a tortilla in the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook both sides of the tortilla slightly to take off any chill and prevent it from being toasted unevenly. Do not fully toast it.</li>
            <li>Take the sliced cheese and break it over a half of the tortilla to the amount that you desire.</li>
            <li>Let the cheese melt slightly, then fold the other half of the tortilla over the half that has cheese on top with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Once the bottom half of the tortilla is toasted to the desired amount, flip the quesadilla over to toast the other half.</li>
            <li>Once both sides are toasted, the tortilla should be ready to eat! If desired, the tortilla can be cut into slices with a knife or pizza cutter.</li>
        </ol>
